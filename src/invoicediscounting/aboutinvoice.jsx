                        <h2 className='mb-3'>About Invoice Discounting</h2>
                        <p >Indian market consists of both small entrepreneurs and large
                            business houses. The Indian economy is not just dependent on the huge business houses but
                            also on small entrepreneurs. The small businesses and start-ups are the ones who are
                            enthusiastic about their work and bring about rapid change and development in the economy.
                            However, being a small player they are in constant need of continuous and regular cash flow.
                            But for small businesses it sometimes becomes difficult to strike a balance between cash
                            inflows and cash outflows of the business. Sufficient working capital ensures that the
                            enterprise is running effectively and efficiently. But sometimes the unavailability of
                            adequate funds can cause hindrance in running a business. This is where one of the most
                            lucrative options comes into play: the concept of invoice discounting. With invoice
                            discounting, small businesses or entrepreneurs can leverage their outstanding invoice, i.e.
                            bills receivable to generate funds required to overcome the operational expenses.</p>

                    <h5>What is Invoice Discounting?</h5>
                    <p>Invoice discounting also called Bill Discounting is a way in which a company can borrow short
                        term funds from banks or financial institutions based on their outstanding invoices. Invoice
                        Discounting is a manner in which businesses can raise short-term funds to meet short-term
                        liquidity needs. Invoice Discounting is an alternative to a business loan or an overdraft
                        facility. Under Invoice Discounting, the company provides the unpaid bills to the banks or
                        financial institutions and in return, receives funds up to 90% of the outstanding bill value. It
                        helps keep cash inflow from customers constant and they can pay within their normal credit
                        period.</p>

                <div className="tab-pane fade" id="nav-Needed" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-Needed-tab">
                    <h5>Why is Invoice Discounting needed?</h5>
                    <p>Generally, in start-ups or small businesses, the entrepreneur sells goods to customers in large
                        quantities and on credit. When a sales transaction is carried out on credit, it means the
                        payment for such purchases shall be made at a later date. Usually, the credit period offered
                        varies from bank to bank. However, such a credit transaction creates a shortage of working
                        capital due to payment at a future date thereby locking the amount receivable. So, rather than
                        waiting for the credit cycle to end, small entrepreneurs can borrow money with the help of
                        invoice discounting and invest it in growing the business.</p>

                <div className="tab-pane fade" id="nav-Work" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-Work-tab">
                    <h5>How does Invoice Discounting work?</h5>
                    <p>Invoice discounting is one of the most popular methods for arranging working capital for
                        business. Under invoice discounting facility, the invoice raised for the customer is sold to the
                        bank or financial institution at a discounted price. This implies that the money that the
                        business would receive at the end of the credit period is collected instantly. Generally, all
                        lenders offer this facility at a predetermined percentage of the invoice value, which varies
                        anywhere between 75% - 90% and the rate at which the invoice discounting facility is available
                        varies between 1.5% - 3.00%. Here is how Invoice Discounting works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entrepreneur sells his commodities to the customer and raises a bill or invoice depicting
                            the particulars of the sale, i.e. date of sale, number of products sold, payment due date,
                            etc. As the transaction is a credit transaction, the time taken by the customer to make
                            payment can be delayed till the due date, while the entrepreneur or seller will expect
                            immediate payments.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, to retrieve the lockdown funds, the entrepreneur can reach out to banks or
                            financial institutions for invoice discounting facility</li>
                        <li>The bank or financial institution upon their due diligence shall pay to the entrepreneur as
                            per the predetermined percentage, kindly note, this amount shall be less than the invoice
                            amount. The difference between the actual invoice amount and amount paid by the bank is
                            called the ‘Discounting Fees’ and is taken by the banks or financial institutions.</li>
                        <li>Later, when the customers pay back to the entrepreneur, they can repay the amount to the
                            bank.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With invoice discounting facilities, entrepreneurs can avail funding up to 90% of the invoice
                        value immediately.</p>
