            Yes, that is the good part about these loans that even start-ups and small businesses can apply for these loans and get them. The lenders do not discriminate between giant e-commerce companies and small businesses in this space. However, the amount of loan, interest rates, and other terms and conditions may vary from one borrowing company to another. The bottom line is any e-commerce company can apply for these loans.

            No, another good part about these e-commerce loans is that they are unsecured in nature. It means the borrowing company will not have to pledge any of your assets as collateral against the loan. The lender uses an alternate mechanism to assess your credibility to decide on your loan application.

            This may be a cause of concern for many stalwart e-commerce businesses, but they don’t have to worry about the secrecy of their crucial business information. The lenders have a dedicated team of experienced professionals who manages your information and processes your application. Only the relevant information is shared by these professionals, the remaining information is kept hidden. You can refer to the Privacy Policy page of the lender you are applying for and seek clarification from your relationship manager.

              No, there is no need to physically visit the lender’s office to deposit the instalment amount every month. There are multiple options available online for paying money these days. You just have to select the amount and the lender’s account number to make the payment. There is an option, wherein you can allow the lender to deduct the instalment amount from your account automatically.
