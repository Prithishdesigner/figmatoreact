            Apart from the information provided above, there are specific questions which can pop up in one’s mind, and some of them have been answered below:
            <ul>
           <li>
            <b>What is the line of credit, and how does it work?</b>
            <p>Line of credit is a suitable option for short term operating or business. It allows the applicant to use the sanctioned amount as per the requirement- meaning, fund access is provided and can be used to meet the expenses as and when required. With this, the interest is to be paid on the amount which has been used.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <b>What are the processing fee and interest rate for restaurant business loans?</b>
            <p>The business interest rates start with INR 50 per day per lac, or minimum interest begins at 1.5% per month and is calculated on the reducing balance.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <b>Can a low credit rating affect a Restaurant loan application?</b>
            <p>The chances are that the loan will be sanctioned, but the interest rate might be higher. If improving the credit rating is possible, then give that a try before applying for a business loan.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <b>Can the restaurant business loan be pre-closed?</b>
            <p>Yes, that is an option with a pre-closure charge. However, at least one EMI has to be paid to pre-close the loan.</p>
