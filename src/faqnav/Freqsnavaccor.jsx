If you are seeking an easy small business loan, this is it. Term loans for businesses are helpful when the financing need is time-bound and properly described. These loans have a particular payback term and can provide floating or fixed interest rates. Depending on the tenure, terms loans can be classNameified into long-term, short-term and intermediate-term loans. Terms loans can be either secured or unsecured and serve different purposes like purchasing new equipment, increasing working capital, or expanding office premises.</div>

Apart from banks and credit unions, FinTech firms now offer this loan. Every business term loan is different. The loan amount usually ranges anywhere from a few thousand to several lacs. Your business or personal credit score, time length in business operation, and revenue of your company are fundamental factors which decide how much a financial lending institution wants to provide and what the rate of interest for that loan will be. Generally, the APR (Annual Percentage Rating) starts around 6% and reaches up to 99%.</div>

With a line of credit, businesses are offered a credit limit they can take up against whenever they require it and are free to use the funds on the expenses of their choice. Line of credit is best for short-term operating purposes and for instant revenue-creating activities because the entrepreneur can use funds when he/she requires them. After opening a line of credit, you will get fund access. Then you will get a monthly invoice reflecting the credit amount you have used alongside interest charges (if any). Your payment depends on the actual interest accrued on these funds while you utilize them. Once you repay the funds, the amount is available for use. You will just be charged interest on the loan amount you use.</div>

Invoice discounting has become a prime source of working capital funds which relies on collaterals of the invoice due from the debtor if the amount is borrowed from a traditional lender. There is unsecured invoice discounting which is an alternative to conventional business loans that offers you immediate access to cash stuck in your outstanding invoices. With an invoice discounting, don’t wait to get paid by your customers, rather get instant money against your invoices through FinMSME.</div>

Hence, Merchant Cash Advance is best suited for such businesses with significant transactions occurring through card swipes. It advances cash to merchants depending on predicted future sales, providing an alternative to the traditional bank loan. With a Merchant Cash Advance, businesses get an amount of money in return for a percentage of their future earnings. Businesses basically require money to maximize credit, stock more inventory, reach out to more clients or extend their operation and a Merchant Cash Advance helps businesses meeting their instant cash needs.</div>
