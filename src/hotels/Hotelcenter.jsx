                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Micro-lenders:</h6>
                    <p>These are lenders that provide tiny, short-term loans to individuals. It is the route to take if you cannot obtain a standard bank loan due to a variety of factors. Getting a loan from the bank may take some time. Nonetheless, it is a viable alternative for small enterprises without a track record of operations or assets to receive a loan.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Online lenders:</h6>
                    <p>Online lenders like NBFCs are popular with customers who want hotel loans quickly. They expeditiously process applications and disburse funds within 24 hours. However, interest rates may be greater than those offered by traditional lenders.</p>

            Understand the different loan options available. It enables you to choose the loan which will meet your needs. Several of your alternatives are shown below:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h6>Term loan:</h6>
                    <p>It is the recommended method of payment. Banks often provide the most competitive interest rates and flexible repayment arrangements. It is the source of financing for a hotel. However, if you want an asset-free loan, this may not be the best option.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Invoice discounting:</h6>
                    <p>It is a short-term loan instrument that helps businesses plan their operating cash flow. You have a few customers that buy in bulk from you. They occasionally want more time to pay. In addition, you'll need money to run your business. In this instance, invoice discounting can be a good option. In this situation, you sell your invoice to a lender for less than the amount shown on the invoice. The lender buys it and compensates you, allowing you to keep running your business. You promptly reimburse the loan in full after the customer makes the payment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Credit line:</h6>
                    <p>It is a legally binding agreement between you and the lender. You and the lender agree on a maximum amount of money you can borrow, and the lender agrees to let you borrow up to that amount. In terms of pay-out durations, this choice offers the most flexibility. Interest rates, on the other hand, may rise. You don't know when you'll need to use your credit card. You can, however, borrow again after your current debt has been paid off.</p>
            
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Merchant cash advance:</h6>
                    <p>In this case, you receive an advance based on credit card sales. It is possibly the quickest method of obtaining operating cash for your organization.</p>
